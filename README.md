## Image Assets
All images are manually added to this project's repository to ensure data longevity. As such, images are sourced from various sites when the original manufacturer's imagery is missing or out of date. The following table shows the expected size for each asset:

|  Collection  | Width | Height | File Type |
|--------------|-------|--------|-----------|
|    Amiibo    | 110px | 118px  |  .PNG     |
| Switch Games | 500px | 810px  |  .JPG     |
